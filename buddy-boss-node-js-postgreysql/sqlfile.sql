14 Tesla features your regular car definitely doesn’t have	<p>Here's a rundown of the Tesla-only features that make Tesla, well, Tesla.</p><h2>1. Only one touchscreen</h2><p><img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00OAxbVw7IHsfxGGa1wCFNw/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1622662360.jpg" alt="The Tesla experience is like no other." srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00OAxbVw7IHsfxGGa1wCFNw/images-2.fit_lim.size_800x.v1622662360.jpg 800w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00OAxbVw7IHsfxGGa1wCFNw/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1622662360.jpg 1400w,https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00OAxbVw7IHsfxGGa1wCFNw/images-2.fit_lim.size_2000x.v1622662360.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" width="2000"></p><p>The Tesla experience is like no other. Credit: Yuriko Nakao / Getty Images</p><p>Tesla's newest cars are the Model 3 and Y; both feature the same sparse interior with a single center screen that controls everything you need to do, from running the car and playing the radio to finding driving directions. No other car has such a pared-down layout. Even the button to open the glove compartment is on the one and only screen.</p><h2>2. Autopilot</h2><p>Available since around 2015, Autopilot started as an extra feature you could add for a hefty fee to complement your driving. The advanced driving system would auto-steer, keep up with other vehicles, brake for slower traffic, and generally help out with highway driving, as long as the driver kept eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, most of those features come included as part of Tesla's basic safety system. But there's also Full Self-Driving mode, for a current upgrade price of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-fsd-10000">$10,000</a>, which claims to be hands-free driving that can stop at stop signs and traffic lights, make automatic lane changes, and eventually auto-steer on any road, even off the highway. So far only a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-full-self-driving-autonomous-fail">select group of beta testers</a> are using the full FSD package. It's been a rough start, with FSD mode struggling in dense, urban areas.</p><h2>3. Supercharging</h2><p>Tesla has its own charging network, exclusive to Tesla owners. Other EVs (like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rivian-fast-charging-network">Rivian</a> and Jeep) are starting to build out their own networks as well, but none are as extensive as Tesla's. Supercharging is available across the U.S. and in other countries where Teslas are sold: There are more than <a href="https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;bounds=71.03065698181362%2C51.909926841075226%2C-10.61920957239083%2C158.78492684107528&amp;zoom=3&amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop%2Csupercharger">25,000 superchargers</a>. The fast charging adds up to 200 miles in 15 minutes. No longer free like it was in the early days of Tesla, you either pay by the minute or kilowatt using a credit card loaded into the car computer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Free over-the-air updates</h2><p>Other car companies are catching up, but Tesla was the first to treat its cars like cellphones. Just like you update your iPhone with the latest iOS via a free over-the-air software update, Tesla's software connects to WiFi and can update a long list of car functions. When there was a braking problem a few years ago, an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-model3-braking-software-update-consumer-reports/">OTA update even fixed that</a>.</p>	Featured	2022-05-25T06:03:43.508Z	2022-05-25T06:03:43.508Z	28	10	79	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653458683636%20-%20hero-image.webp?alt=media&token=518cd665-de2a-420f-8fb7-7db3a3fb837d	f

football | History, Rules, & 'Significant' Players - Encyclopedia	<p><strong>football</strong>, also called <strong>association football</strong> or <strong>soccer</strong>, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins.</p><p>Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653383975165?alt=media&amp;token=3a0aa804-94c2-44fa-ae4b-ab142053fa41"></figure><h2>History</h2><h2>The early years</h2><p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653384029063?alt=media&amp;token=ec0640b8-d68f-4590-a5ac-cc6a50d761d3"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The new rules were not universally accepted in Britain, however; many clubs retained their own rules, especially in and around Sheffield. Although this northern English city was the home of the first provincial club to join the FA, in 1867 it also gave birth to the Sheffield Football Association, the forerunner of later county associations. Sheffield and London clubs played two matches against each other in 1866, and a year later a match pitting a club from Middlesex against one from Kent and Surrey was played under the revised rules. In 1871 15 FA clubs accepted an invitation to enter a cup competition and to contribute to the purchase of a trophy. By 1877 the associations of Great Britain had agreed upon a uniform code, 43 clubs were in competition, and the London clubs’ initial dominance had diminished.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653384058567?alt=media&amp;token=76962df2-c765-4bce-ab79-f56211c4d75e"></figure><h2>Professionalism</h2><p>The development of modern football was closely tied to processes of industrialization and urbanization in Victorian Britain. Most of the new working-class inhabitants of Britain’s industrial towns and cities gradually lost their old bucolic pastimes, such as badger-baiting, and sought fresh forms of collective leisure. From the 1850s onward, industrial workers were increasingly likely to have Saturday afternoons off work, and so many turned to the new game of football to watch or to play.

Best Ferrari Cars in India in 2021 	<p>Italian luxury sports car manufacturer, Ferrari, is probably the best-known car brand in the automobile world. While the brand was founded in 1939, it officially made its way to India in 2011. Offering stunning looks, superior specifications, and a lot of speed, Ferrari is a name that very few sports cars can match up to. Luxury and performance are what we can all expect from a Ferrari vehicle and that is exactly what they deliver. So, without delaying it further, here are the best Ferrari cars available in India in 2021.</p><h2><strong>Ferrari Roma</strong></h2><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653459042635?alt=media&amp;token=1f529154-550f-4089-aebe-92b10e548985"></figure><p>If what you’re after is looks, the Ferrari Roma has to be the only option for you. The luxurious sports car has got a sleek finish with a streamlined design. The front grille houses the Ferrari branding and the logo is also found on the front bumper just below the bonnet. The Roma has new LED headlamps and LED DRLs. The front bumper also has a large air dam below the grille which helps the Roma reach top speeds quicker.

Some of the features found on the Ferrari Roma include power steering, automatic climate control, air quality control, remote access, heated front seats, cruise control, navigation system, keyless entry, and ignition. In terms of safety, the Roma comes with 6 airbags for the driver and the passengers, side-impact beams, traction control, engine immobilizer, ABS with EBD, and a blind-spot monitor.</p><h2><strong>Ferrari Roma New Car Price in Popular Cities</strong></h2><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>City</strong></td><td><strong>Ex-Showroom Price</strong></td><td><strong>On-Road Price</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>New Delhi</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mumbai</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chennai</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hyderabad</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bengaluru</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Kolkata</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pune</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Kochi</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 3.76 Crore</strong></td><td><strong>Rs. 4.32 Crore</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>Ferrari Portofino</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Replacing the 2015 Ferrari California T, the Ferrari Portofino was officially launched in India in September 2018 at a price of 3.5 Crore.

Tata Titans - Jamsetji Tata	<p>amsetji Tata was more than just the entrepreneur who helped India take her place in the league of industrialised nations. He was a patriot and a humanist whose ideals and vision shaped an exceptional business conglomerate.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The industrialist in Jamsetji was a pioneer and a visionary, possessed of a spirit of entrepreneurial adventure and acumen never seen before or since in a native of colonial India. The nationalist in him believed unwaveringly that the fruits of his business success would enrich a country he cared deeply about. These attributes, by themselves, would have been enough to mark him as an extraordinary figure. But what made Jamsetji truly unique, the quality that places him in the pantheon of modern India's greatest sons, was his humaneness.</p><p>It is this characteristic from which stemmed Jamsetji's generosity of heart and his compassion for a citizenry labouring under the twin realities of oppressive foreign occupation and overwhelming poverty. The distinctive structure the Tata group came to adopt after Jamsetji's passing, with a huge part of its assets being held by trusts devoted to ploughing money into social-development initiatives, can be traced directly to the empathy embedded in the Founder's philosophy of business.</p>	Featured	2022-05-25T06:33:05.584Z	2022-05-25T06:33:05.584Z	29	10	93	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653460490086%20-%20i1234ndex.jpeg?alt=media&token=de056067-d3e3-4022-8711-05cd8654a63c	f

What Are the Rules of Basketball?	<p>From NBA basketball to the Olympic games to pick-up games at the local gym, basketball is a popular sport able to be played at multiple skill levels.

When a player has the basketball there are certain rules they must follow:</p><p><a href="https://www.ducksters.com/sports/basketballrules.php#">Ad</a></p><p><br>1) The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.&nbsp;<br><br>2) The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass.</p><p><br>3) The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball.&nbsp;<br><br>4) The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the other team.&nbsp;<br><br>5) Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into the backcourt. This is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team knocks the ball into the backcourt, then the offensive team can recover the ball legally.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T06:03:53.397Z	Tue May 24 2022 12:15:08 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)	23	7	47	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653372254314%20-%20csm_finnian-hadiep-ZDmbF9hxaFE-unsplash_d1cd27cc9b.jpg?alt=media&token=a7ceddcb-dfae-4ed3-9d64-90bc5359182b	f
\r\nLearn how to play soccer.The first technical football steps to be a top footballer	<h3>The “Game is the Teacher” but get soccer basics right</h3><p>There is a saying amongst the football world where the <strong>“game is the teacher”.</strong> This concept is that you will learn to play football just by playing the game, most often in small sided games and matches. Whilst this is true to a great extent as team based play and training is most realistic, it becomes very difficult to refine and learn technique which is vital to improve the level of your game and is the foundation from which all football is built.</p><p>Soccer technique covers a variety of areas which should all be practised when learning how to play football.

Technique can be tricky to master hence often it is easiest to start alone in an unopposed environment. Break the technique down into understandable chunks and build them back up. It is very similar to learning to play a musical piece where you learn to master one bar at a time but being mindful of the end goal. With technique it is all about repetition and purposeful practice to building up that muscle memory and brain circuitry. Where possible also try practices with multiple outcomes because at the end of the day, it is all about playing football matches so realistic game based training is key.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T06:46:51.606Z	Tue May 24 2022 12:19:12 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)	21	7	48	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653374872313%20-%20csm_fauzan-saari-cjYQBSKDSII-unsplash_c897143c94.jpg?alt=media&token=fd36b276-6a6b-4cb2-b9b9-a3844aa8c488	f

History of basketball!!!	<p>The <strong>history of basketball</strong> began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653382503123?alt=media&amp;token=210802be-739f-4b79-a702-40b699ceeb15"></figure><p>Basketball began in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts when Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith invented it. Naismith was a 31-year-old physical education graduate student at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, which is now Springfield College. Naismith wanted to make a game that was simple to learn, yet sophisticated enough to keep players interested. Indoors, the game had to be playable, and it had to be able to handle multiple players at the same time. The game had to provide the pupils with lots of exercises while avoiding the violence of football or rugby, which could cause more serious injuries if played in a restricted setting. This is how the idea of basketball came into Naismith’s mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653382781480?alt=media&amp;token=0aa175eb-af9d-4243-a749-b794e75b583c"></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>The game of basketball originated in December 1891 by a Canadian born man by the name of James Naismith.</p><p>Naismith was a teacher at the YMCA training school in Springfield, Massachusetts.

 Who Is Elon Musk? 	<h2>Early Life and Education&nbsp;</h2><p>Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971&nbsp;in Pretoria, South Africa, the oldest of three children. His father was a South African engineer, his mother a Canadian model and nutritionist.34</p><p>After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived primarily with his father. He would later dub his father "a terrible human being… almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."3</p><p>“I had a terrible upbringing. I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don’t face enough adversity,” Musk would later say.5</p><h3>Bullied as a Child&nbsp;</h3><p>Musk attended the private, English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School—he started a year early—and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. A self-described bookworm, he made few friends in those places.</p><p>“They got my best (expletive) friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that (expletive) hurt,” Musk said. “For some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going to go after me nonstop. That’s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the (expletive) out of me, and then I’d come home, and it would just be awful there as well.”6</p><h3>Early Accomplishments&nbsp;</h3><p>Technology became an escape for Musk. At 10, he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC-20, an early and relatively inexpensive home computer. Before long, Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar—a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a PC magazine for $500.7</p><p>In one telling incident from his childhood, Musk and his brother, planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Their parents nixed the plan.8</p><h3>Musk's College Years&nbsp;</h3><p>At 17, Musk moved to Canada. He would later obtain Canadian citizenship through his mother.9</p><p>After emigrating to Canada, Musk&nbsp;enrolled in&nbsp;Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. It was there that he met Justine Wilson, an aspiring writer. They would marry and have five sons together, twins and triplets, before divorcing in 2008.</p>	Featured	2022-05-25T06:16:51.226Z	2022-05-25T06:16:51.226Z	29	10	85	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653459475562%20-%20how-elon-musk-became-elon-musk_final-43ef802cd2414d14a8bf3967f319ce18.webp?alt=media&token=6260898c-71b9-468d-9c4f-10fc62d908bd	f

10 best hockey "games" for "Android"	<p>Hockey is the last of the big four sports in North America, although it also has a good international following.

They can post anything and it doesn’t really matter, while those of us in the Association have accountability and have standards.”</p><p>Practicing a free form of journalism where anything goes, amateur bloggers are not required to uphold media ethics because they are not accountable to a higher authority, such as an editor or publisher.</p><p>While professional journalists are required to offer the same immediate form of media, they must still report factual and accurate news, and because professional blogs must uphold these standards, they hold a level of reliability over postings by amateur bloggers.</p><p>Some bloggers tend to post anything and everything, regardless of truth or accuracy, which can create problems because blogs that have been established as reliable must fight harder to be recognized among the established media.</p><p>“Personally, I believe that as long as a guy has proven himself to be a guy who dedicates his profession to [blogging], he deserves to be taken seriously,” Allen said.</p><p><strong><img src="https://www.usahockeymagazine.com/sites/default/files/images/0808-Blog-1.jpg" alt="New York Islander fans have expressed their opinions and their loyalties on their blogs, which are endorsed by the team.">New York Islander fans have expressed their opinions and their loyalties on their blogs, which are endorsed by the team.</strong></p><p>As the debate continues to wage on, the transformations are hitting every level of hockey from grassroots to the National Hockey League as organizations across the country are starting to take a proactive approach to blogging and rethinking what constitutes a “real journalist.”</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><h2>“... having fans get involved is a great way to pull your fans into the game and into&nbsp;<br>the sport.”<br>&nbsp;</h2></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The New York Islanders have been at the front of the pack in allowing bloggers to attend games at Nassau Coliseum. Implementing an auxiliary press box, normally used to accommodate overflow during the playoffs, the Islanders have encouraged fans with running blogs to attend games as members of the press.</p><p>“We saw that blogging is becoming a major force on the Internet and is a tool for news reporting,” said Corey Witt, media relations coordinator for the Islanders. “Instead of shying away from it, we wanted to dive right in.”</p><p>The Islanders presented fans, most of whom are season ticket holders, with the opportunity to apply to become active members of the media.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Applications to earn media credentials went up in May 2007 and established hockey bloggers, not necessarily those covering the Islanders, were chosen based on quality and unique traits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>“The program was designed to have fans watch the game and blog,” Witt said. “The regular press box has rules that you can’t wear jerseys or cheer when a goal is scored, but these fans are actually encouraged to do that because they are basically sitting with the crowd, and after the game they are given full access to the Islanders like regular media.”</p><p>Striking franchise gold, the Islanders’ forward thinking has been successful on several levels. From a press standpoint, the Islanders receive more coverage at their games. From a fan standpoint, a deeper-seeded connection was formed because bloggers were embraced rather than shunned. From a business standpoint, the Islanders had sponsorships come up for the new press box. Witt described it as a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p><p>“Everyone seems skeptical about it at first, but when they talk to us and see how successful it was, they sort of saw where we were coming from,” Witt said. “I suspect other teams in the NHL will follow suit in the next year.”</p><p>The future of blogging is clear. It is a new form of media that not only provides teams with more coverage but also allows the game to grow and solidify a fan base.</p><p>“Technology can change a lot,” said Helene Elliott, sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times. “I think having interactive things, having fans get involved, is a great way to pull your fans into the game and into the sport.”</p><p>With the endless possibilities, blogging is the future of sports journalism whether the mainstream media is ready or not.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T10:43:43.138Z	Tue May 24 2022 17:12:36 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)	24	7	63	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653389057427%20-%20Jacques-Plante.webp?alt=media&token=c8953578-c183-40bd-a18a-5c19e711ba2e	f

Panner Masala	<p>Paneer Butter Masala is basically a Punjabi dish where fresh Indian cottage cheese is cooked in a creamy rich tomato onion base. Restaurant chefs have altered the recipe, with loads of butter, powdered nuts and cream to offer their customers a tasty treat.

Cheese Balls	<p>Cheese balls</p><p>Crispy and golden on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside, these delectable deep-fried Potato and Cheese Balls are the stuff of dreams.

I found that when I tried the traditional method of making them, half of the cheese balls came out perfect (HOORAY!) and half of them broke in the oil (ARGH!).</p><p>I figured out that with the traditional recipe, the oil had to be the perfect temperature <i>the entire time</i> for all the balls to fry successfully. This is difficult to do even as a professionally trained chef or in a limited kitchen environment, so I wanted to find a better and fail-proof solution.</p><p>One day while I was making cheese stuffed fritters (bread pakora), I mixed some grated cheese with the leftover gram flour (besan) batter and made pan-fried fritters. To my surprise, these spur-of-the-moment fritters tasted damn good and came out much better than the traditional cheese balls I had made with all-purpose flour.</p><p>Using that experiment as my springboard, I tried making cheese balls with mashed potatoes and gram flour (besan) instead of all-purpose flour. The result was exactly what I wanted: crispy golden cheese balls with a creamy, cheesy interior.</p><p>And the best part? ALL the balls fried perfectly from start to finish.

The Top 10 Most Expensive Cars In The World	<p><strong>10. Zenvo ST1 ($1.2M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/zenvo.jpg" alt="Zenvo ST1"></p><p>Kicking off our list is less of a car and more of an unchained animal in the ST1. Assembled in Zealand, Denmark, the Zenvo creates an absolutely obscene amount of power by combining a 6.8-liter V8 with both a supercharger and a turbocharger. Just how much is obscene exactly? How about 1,104 horsepower and 1,054 pound-feet of torque, all channeled to the car’s rear wheels.</p><p><strong>9. Ferrari LaFerrari ($1.4M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/ferrari.jpg" alt="ferrari"></p><p>Few cars on the road are more striking, and even fewer accelerate faster. With a dry weight of less than 2,800 pounds, this dragon-like performance car accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds, and it’ll prance to 124 mph in under 7. Flat out, it’ll top 217 mph.</p><p><strong>8. Pagani Huayra ($1.4M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/pagani-huayra.jpg" alt="pagani-huayra"></p><p>The Huayra is equally as famous for its odd-sounding name as it is for its face-melting performance. Named after the Incan God of Winds, the Huayra (pronounced why-rah) boasts an AMG-sourced 6.0-liter V12 with two turbochargers, resulting in 620 hp and and a massive 740 lb-ft.</p><p><strong>7. Aston Martin One-77 ($1.4M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/aston-martin.jpg" alt="aston-martin"></p><p>Under the vented hood lurks a naturally aspirated V12 that displaces 7.3 liters, which is a lot. It produces 750 hp and 553 lb-ft, which is also a lot. Those numbers make the One-77 the fastest Aston Martin ever made, as this spy chaser will top 220 mph in the right conditions. From a stop, it’ll do 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.</p><p><strong>6. Koenigsegg One:1 ($2.0M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/koenigsegg.jpg" alt=""></p><p>You can buy a lot with $2 million — a really nice house, about 80 Mazda MX-5’s, or the Swedish “megacar” shown above. A logical thinker could probably think of a better way to spend your life savings, but megacars don’t give a damn about logic. Because they’re mega. And after reading what the car is capable of, $2 million might actually be a steal.</p><p><strong>5. Ferrari F60 America ($2.5M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/ferrari-f60.jpg" alt="ferrari-f60"></p><p>The supercar is mechanically identical to the F12, but the Berlinetta isn’t exactly a Fiat Panda to begin with. Its 6.2-liter V12 churns out 740 glorious hp, enough to propel the car to 60 mph in only 3.1 seconds. The ultra-rare flag-waver hearkens back to Ferrari’s bespoke past, as the company built several region-specific sports cars in the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p><strong>4. Mansory Vivere Bugatti Veyron ($3.4M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/bugatti.jpg" alt="bugatti"></p><p>This list wouldn’t be complete without some version of the mighty Bugatti Veyron. We’re shining our spotlight on the the Mansory Vivere edition here, because not only is it one of the fastest cars in the world, it’s one of the most expensive.</p><p><strong>3. W Motors Lykan Hypersport ($3.4M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/lykan-hypersport.jpg" alt="lykan-hypersport"></p><p>You may recall the Lykan Hypersport from its starring role in the blockbuster Furious 7, where the Lebanese supercar crashed through not one, not two, but three skyscrapers in Dubai. In a franchise filled with high-end exotics and one-off custom creations, the fact that the Hypersport got so much focus is a testament to its magnetism.</p><p><strong>2. Lamborghini Veneno ($4.5M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/lamborghini.jpg" alt="lamborghini"></p><p>The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and to this day, we’re not convinced it isn’t an alien spacecraft surveying our planet for eventual takeover. It just doesn’t seem real. The only thing more remarkable than the look is the price — a whopping $4.5 million.</p><p><strong>1. Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita ($4.8M)</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.boxymo.ie/news/img/koenigsegg-trevita.jpg" alt="koenigsegg-trevita"></p><p>Underneath the lustrous finish lies a 4.8-liter, dual-supercharged V8 with a total output of 1,004 hp and 797 lb-ft, which means it should have little to no trouble overtaking semis on the freeway. The car’s specifications — in both performance and price — are nearly comical at this point, and just three were ever made.</p><p>Alex Todd Brand Manager at BoxyMo commented "The 1931 Bugatti Royale Kellner Coupe was sold for $8.7 million in 1987. That and many others won’t be included in this list, they are no longer available in the market."</p>	Featured	2022-05-25T06:00:13.391Z	2022-05-25T06:00:13.391Z	28	10	78	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653458544085%20-%20index.jpeg?alt=media&token=6eb11410-76f3-4a7b-8581-a75c9660acd8	f

The Must-Learn Skill to Skyrocket "dfd" Growth in "chess"123e	<p>Command an army. Sharpen your mind. Outwit your opponent. Have fun. You’ll get all this and more with chess, a game of strategy that has been challenging the world’s greatest thinkers for 15 centuries.</p><p>Playing the game can be tough. That’s why we asked 23-year-old chess grandmaster and Eagle Scout Kayden Troff for his nine tips to become a better player.</p><p><br><strong>1. WORK HARD</strong></p><p>Chess is a game of skill. That means it requires lots of hard work. Schedule times for practice, reading and studying.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653372055390?alt=media&amp;token=a0ce867d-c47c-4a57-bc1d-eb4e02c8df85"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>2. HAVE FUN</p><p>Because chess is so demanding to play, it’s easy to forget to simply have fun while sitting at the board. Smile, laugh and enjoy the thrill of competition.</p><p><br>3. FIND YOUR STYLE</p><p>You might feel more comfortable defending your pieces, or maybe you have a knack for attacking. Either way, identify your style so you can steer the game in that direction. Plus, identifying your strengths will help you improve your weaknesses.</p><p><br>4. DON’T GIVE UP</p><p>Kayden says there have been plenty of times he was able to draw or win games others thought he should have lost. That’s because he doesn’t let errors get him down. If you make a mistake, it’s easy to give up or mentally check out. Don’t!</p><p>Chances are, if you keep playing and stay positive, you’ll see things aren’t as bad as you thought.</p><p><br>5. PLAY OFTEN</p><p>Whether it’s with family, friends or on your smartphone, find a way to play daily. There are plenty of great resources for anyone interested in playing chess, from newbie to expert.</p><p><br>6. CONTROL THE CENTER</p><p>The four squares in the center of the board are ideal to have in your control. That’s the gateway to the rest of the board, allowing you to move your pieces wherever you want. Just be careful about leaving your king in the middle of the board too long; it exposes that all-important piece to attacks.</p><p><br>7. DEVELOP YOUR PIECES</p><p>Some people get caught up pushing pawns or focusing on one specific piece. Use the full arsenal of each of your pieces. They’re there for a reason. Move them off their first position and get them in the fight!</p><p><br>8. WATCH YOUR QUEEN EARLY</p><p>Your queen is the strongest piece. Sometimes players get too eager to move it out and start attacking. Instead, allow your opponent to develop his pieces before moving your queen into the mix.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653372104412?alt=media&amp;token=c6a4ad5b-2314-4743-b686-5dc4555a10d4"></figure><p><br>9. CALCULATE IT</p><p>Calculating is the term for looking four or five or more moves ahead of what’s currently on the board. It’s a skill that needs to be developed over time, but one that separates good players from great ones.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T05:56:37.818Z	Wed Jun 08 2022 17:37:13 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)	19	7	46	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653371819475%20-%201585890401910500132.jpg?alt=media&token=738e9c66-ea3e-4213-8074-ad8135e77454 	f
All Domestic Cricket Tournaments In India 	<p><i><strong>Cricket tournaments in India:</strong></i> Looking back at the resources Indian cricket had a decade ago versus now in the matter of players, infrastructure, finance, and the hold in World cricket, the difference is astonishing. Very recently India sent two different teams, one to play Sri Lanka for a T20I and ODI series and the other squad for a 5-match test series in England.

Narendra Modi	<p>Narendra Damodardas Modi is the 15th Prime Minister of India and assumed office in May 2014. He was re-elected in the 17th Lok Sabha from Varanasi and led the Bhartiya Janata Party to a massive victory for a second term during 2019 Lok Sabha elections Before his role as the prime minister, he served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. He has been an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the past. Since coming to power, Modi has single-handedly made BJP the most powerful party in the country with power in most of the state. On July 20, he survived a no-confidence motion brought against his government by the TDP with a thumping margin. Narendra Modi is one of the most followed names on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Modi's rise in the BJP has been phenomenal. Ensuring three consecutive election victories for the party in Gujarat, Modi launched himself on to the national stage. Despite stiff opposition from party patriarch LK Advani, Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate for Lok Sabha elections in 2014.

Accuracy is the key when it comes to passing and receiving. It makes open play fluid and ensures constant progress up the field that can result in creating scoring opportunities.</p><p>“When you see top leagues around the world, the ball doesn’t really stop once it is received. It is constantly moving in the direction that it needs to go to build up play,” Chhangte says.</p><p>According to him, receiving the ball correctly is the first step, which in turn can open up multiple options to make the right pass. A smooth transition can lead to promising attacking situations.</p><p>“If the pass isn’t great, there’s a chance of losing the ball and handing the opposition the opportunity to counterattack. So both these skills work together and need to be executed correctly,” he says.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T09:02:15.510Z	2022-05-24T09:02:15.510Z	21	7	51	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653383586262%20-%20istockphoto-1320104452-170667a.jpg?alt=media&token=ce0e5264-b760-4116-828f-3790cc869742	f

History of Vollyball	<p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of basketball too vigorous. Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of “volleyball.” The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the <i>Official Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America</i> (1897). The game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653385122986?alt=media&amp;token=bc11f05a-b221-43d0-8f11-4149e44309f4"></figure><p>In 1916 rules were issued jointly by the YMCA and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate.&nbsp;</p><p>Biden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden.

Buffett: A Brief History 	<p>Buffett&nbsp;follows the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bengraham.asp">Benjamin Graham</a> school of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">value investing</a>. Value investors look for securities with prices that are unjustifiably low based on their intrinsic worth. There isn't a universally accepted way to determine intrinsic worth, but it's most often estimated by analyzing a company's fundamentals.</p><p>Like bargain hunters, the value investor searches for stocks believed to be <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp">undervalued</a> by the market, or stocks that are valuable but not recognized by the majority of other buyers.</p><p>Buffett takes this value investing approach to another level. Many value investors do not support the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp">efficient market hypothesis</a> (EMH). This theory suggests that stocks always trade at their fair value, which makes it harder for investors to either buy stocks that are&nbsp;undervalued or sell them at inflated prices.</p><p>They do trust that the market will eventually start to favor those quality stocks that were, for a time, undervalued.</p><p>Warren Buffett has continuously stressed the importance of investing in yourself as a means to success. This includes prudent financial choices as well as increasing your knowledge in the areas you seek to take part in.</p><p>Buffett, however, isn't concerned with the supply and demand intricacies of the stock market. In fact, he's not really concerned with the activities of the stock market at all. This is the implication in his famous paraphrase of a Benjamin Graham quote: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine."5</p><p>He looks at each company as a whole, so he chooses stocks solely based on their overall potential as a company. Holding these stocks as a long-term play, Buffett doesn't seek <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp">capital gain</a>, but ownership in quality companies extremely capable of generating earnings.</p><p>When Buffett invests in a company, he isn't concerned with whether the market will eventually recognize its worth. He is concerned with how well that company can make money as a business.</p>	Featured	2022-05-25T06:20:25.542Z	2022-05-25T06:20:25.542Z	29	10	87	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653459697485%20-%20buffetts-road-to-riches-bf79a6d733be4d8a94c260f31bdd3dda.webp?alt=media&token=e65f1080-cf22-4e19-bc6b-b965ec6a767a	f

Chole Bhature	<p>Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/ckeditor%2F1653385493970?alt=media&amp;token=79f71e9b-fce3-4322-973e-8402ccbbea09"></p><p>This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chickpea curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a homely taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.</p>	Featured	2022-05-24T09:41:06.963Z	Tue May 24 2022 17:55:27 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)	25	9	55	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/buddy-boss-article.appspot.com/o/images%2F1653385529192%20-%20chole.jpg?alt=media&token=9940815b-3e89-43c0-b8a7-0f8bcf898a68	f
